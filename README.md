# Recipes

Recipes is a recipe app (really?) based on the dummyJSON API, created by Guilherme Nascimento during John Komarnicki's Build Modern Apps with Nuxt crash course.

It was created to review and refresh Nuxt concepts.

## Features

- **Recipe Listing:** Browse a list of recipes with infinite scroll.
- **Recipe Details:** View the full details of a recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and more.
- **Search:** Find recipes by name with a debounced search input.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes, with a mobile-first approach.
- **Skeleton Loaders:** Skeleton loaders provide a better user experience while content is being loaded.
- **Breadcrumbs:** Breadcrumbs on the recipe details page make it easy to navigate back to the homepage.
